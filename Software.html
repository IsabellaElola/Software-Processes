    <!-- Intro-->
    <p class="text-justify text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      As the author explained in Chapter 1, a software process model is a simplified representation
      of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. For example,
      a process activity model shows the activities and their sequence but may not show
      the roles of the people involved in these activities. In this section, I introduce a number of very general process models (sometimes called ‘process paradigms’) and
      present these from an architectural perspective. That is, we see the framework of the
      process but not the details of specific activities.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify text-gray-800 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
      These generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes. Rather,
      they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to
      software development. You can think of them as process frameworks that may be
      extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.

      These models are not mutually exclusive and are often used together, especially
      for large systems development. For large systems, it makes sense to combine some
      of the best features of the waterfall and the incremental development models. You
      need to have information about the essential system requirements to design a software architecture to support these requirements. You cannot develop this incrementally. 
      Sub-systems within a larger system may be developed using different approaches. 
      Parts of the system that are well understood can be specified and developed using 
      a waterfall-based process. Parts of the system which are difficult to specify in 
      advance, such as the user interface, should always be developed using an incremental approach.

<!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
<p class="text-justify text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
  The first published model of the software development process was derived from
  more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated
  in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known
  as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of
  a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process
  activities before starting work on them.

        Normally (although not necessarily), this is the

        Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in earlier

        enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered.

            In principle, the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approved
            (‘signed off’). The following phase should not start until the previous phase has finished. In practice, these stages overlap and feed information to each other. During
            design, problems with requirements are identified. During coding, design problems
            are found and so on. The software process is not a simple linear model but involves
            feedback from one phase to another. Documents produced in each phase may then
            have to be modified to reflect the changes made.</p>

            <p class="text-justify text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Because of the costs of producing and approving documents, iterations can be
            costly and involve significant rework. Therefore, after a small number of iterations,
            it is normal to freeze parts of the development, such as the specification, and to continue with the later development stages. Problems are left for later resolution,
            ignored, or programmed around. This premature freezing of requirements may mean
            that the system won’t do what the user wants. It may also lead to badly structured
            systems as design problems are circumvented by implementation tricks.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed">During the final life cycle phase (operation and maintenance) the software is put
            into use. Errors and omissions in the original software requirements are discovered.
            Program and design errors emerge and the need for new functionality is identified.
            The system must therefore evolve to remain useful. Making these changes (software
            maintenance) may involve repeating previous process stages.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">The waterfall model is consistent with other engineering process models and documentation is produced at each phase. This makes the process visible so managers can
                        monitor progress against the development plan. Its major problem is the inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages. Commitments must be made at an early stage
                        in the process, which makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">In principle, the waterfall model should only be used when the requirements are
                        well understood and unlikely to change radically during system development.
                        However, the waterfall model reflects the type of process used in other engineering
                        projects. As is easier to use a common management model for the whole project,
                        software processes based on the waterfall model are still commonly used.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">An important variant of the waterfall model is formal system development, where
                        a mathematical model of a system specification is created. This model is then
                        refined, using mathematical transformations that preserve its consistency, into executable code. Based on the assumption that your mathematical transformations are
                        correct, you can therefore make a strong argument that a program generated in this
                        way is consistent with its specification.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">Formal development processes, such as that based on the B method (Schneider,
                        2001; Wordsworth, 1996) are particularly suited to the development of systems that
                        have stringent safety, reliability, or security requirements. The formal approach simplifies the production of a safety or security case. This demonstrates to customers or
                        regulators that the system actually meets its safety or security requirements.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">Processes based on formal transformations are generally only used in the development of safety-critical or security-critical systems. They require specialized
                        expertise. For the majority of systems this process does not offer significant costbenefits over other approaches to system development.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Incremental software development, which is a fundamental part of agile approaches, is better than a waterfall approach for most business, e-commerce, and personal systems. Incremental development reflects the way that we solve problems. We rarely work out a complete problem solution in advance but move toward a solution in a series of steps, backtracking when we realize that we have made a mistake. By developing the software incrementally, it is cheaper and easier to make changes in the software as it is being developed.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Each increment or version of the system incorporates some of the functionality that is needed by the customer. Generally, the early increments of the system include the most important or most urgently required functionality. This means that the customer can evaluate the system at a relatively early stage in the development to see if it delivers what is required. If not, then only the current increment has to be changed and, possibly, new functionality defined for later increments.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-6 mb-2">Incremental development has three important benefits, compared to the waterfall
    model:</h3>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-800 leading-relaxed space-y-2 text-justify">
    <li>
    The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced. The
    amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less than is
    required with the waterfall model.
    </li>
    <li>
    It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been
    done. Customers can comment on demonstrations of the software and see how
    much has been implemented. Customers find it difficult to judge progress from
    software design documents.

    More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible, even if all of the functionality has not been included. Customers are able to

            Although incremental development has many advantages, it is not problem-free. The primary cause of the
            difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and there
            may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">Sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons—for example, there may be procedures to ensure
            that the software properly implements external regulations (e.g., in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley
            accounting regulations). Changing these procedures may not be possible so process conflicts may be

    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">Incremental development in some form is now the most common approach for the
    development of application systems. This approach can be either plan-driven, agile,
    or, more usually, a mixture of these approaches. In a plan-driven approach, the system
    increments are identified in advance; if an agile approach is adopted, the early increments are identified but the development of later increments depends on progress and
    customer priorities.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4 font-bold">
    From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems:
    </p>

  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-800 leading-relaxed space-y-2 text-justify mb-4">
    <li>
    The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure
    progress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to produce
    documents that reflect every version of the system.
    </li>

    <li>
    System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Unless time and
    money is spent on refactoring to improve the software, regular change tends to
    corrupt its structure. Incorporating further software changes becomes increasingly difficult and costly.
    </li>
</ol>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The problems of incremental development become particularly acute for large,
    complex, long-lifetime systems, where different teams develop different parts of the
    system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture and the responsibilities
    of the different teams working on parts of the system need to be clearly defined
    with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather than
    developed incrementally.
  </p>

   <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mt-4">
    You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to customers for comment,
    without actually delivering it and deploying it in the customer’s environment.
    Incremental delivery and deployment means that the software is used in real, operational processes. This is not always possible as experimenting with new software can
    disrupt normal business processes. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of incremental delivery in Section 2.3.2.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4">2.1.3 Reuse-oriented software engineering</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">In the majority of software projects, there is some software reuse. This often happens informally when people working on the project know of designs or code that are
    similar to what is required. They look for these, modify them as needed, and incorporate them into their system.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">This informal reuse takes place irrespective of the development process that is
    used. However, in the 21st century, software development processes that focus on the
    reuse of existing software have become widely used. Reuse-oriented approaches rely
    on a large base of reusable software components and an integrating framework for
    the composition of these components. Sometimes, these components are systems in
    their own right (COTS or commercial off-the-shelf systems)  that may provide specific functionality such as word processing or a spreadsheet.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">A general process model for reuse-based development is shown in Figure 2.3.
    Although the initial requirements specification stage and the validation stage are
    comparable with other software processes, the intermediate stages in a reuseoriented process are different.
    </p>

    
    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4 font-bold">
    These stages are:
    </p>

  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-800 leading-relaxed space-y-2 text-justify mb-4">
    <li>
    <span class="font-bold text-blue-800">Component analysis</span> Given the requirements specification, a search is made for
    components to implement that specification. Usually, there is no exact match and
    the components that may be used only provide some of the functionality required.
    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="font-bold text-blue-800">Requirements modification</span> During this stage, the requirements are analyzed using
    information about the components that have been discovered. They are then modified to reflect the available components. Where modifications are impossible, the
    component analysis activity may be re-entered to search for alternative solutions.
    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="font-bold text-blue-800">Development and integration</span>  Software that cannot be externally procured is
    developed, and the components and COTS systems are integrated to create the
    new system. System integration, in this model, may be part of the development
    process rather than a separate activity.

    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="font-bold text-blue-800">System design with reuse</span> During this phase, the framework of the system is
    designed or an existing framework is reused. The designers take into account the
    components that are reused and organize the framework to cater for this. Some
    new software may have to be designed if reusable components are not available.
    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4 font-bold">
    There are three types of software component that may be used in a reuse-oriented process:

    Reuse-oriented software engineering has the obvious advantage of reducing the
    amount of software to be developed and so reducing cost and risks. It usually also
    leads to faster delivery of the software. However, requirements compromises are
    inevitable and this may lead to a system that does not meet the real needs of users.
    Furthermore, some control over the system evolution is lost as new versions of the
    reusable components are not under the control of the organization using them.

   <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Software reuse is very important and the author have dedicated several chapters in the third
    part of the book to this topic. General issues of software reuse and COTS reuse are
    covered in Chapter 16, component-based software engineering in Chapters 17 and
    18, and service-oriented systems in Chapter 19.
