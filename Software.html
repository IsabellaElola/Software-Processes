                    A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product. These activities may involve the development of software from scratch
                    in a standard programming language like Java or C. However, business applications
                    are not necessarily developed in this way. New business software is now often developed by extending and modifying existing systems or by configuring and integrating
                    off-the-shelf software or system components.

                        Software processes are complex and, like all intellectual and creative processes,
                        rely on people making decisions and judgments. There is no ideal process and most
                        organizations have developed their own software development processes. Processes
                        have evolved to take advantage of the capabilities of the people in an organization
                        and the specific characteristics of the systems that are being developed.

                        For some systems, such as critical systems, a very structured development process is required.
                        For business systems, with rapidly changing requirements, a less formal, flexible
                        process is likely to be more effective.

                        Sometimes, software processes are categorized as either plan-driven or agile
                        processes. Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are
                        planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. In agile processes,
                        which I discuss in Chapter 3, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the
                        process to reflect changing customer requirements.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed">
                        As Boehm and Turner (2003) discuss, each approach is suitable for different types of software. Generally, you
                        need to find a balance between plan-driven and agile processes.

                        Although there is no ‘ideal’ software process, there is scope for improving the
                        software process in many organizations. Processes may include outdated techniques
                        or may not take advantage of the best practice in industrial software engineering.
                        Indeed, many organizations still do not take advantage of software engineering
                        methods in their software development.

                        Software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diversity in software processes across an organization is reduced. This leads to improved
                        communication and a reduction in training time, and makes automated process support more economical. Standardization is also an important first step in introducing
                        new software engineering methods and techniques and good software engineering
                        practice. I discuss software process improvement in more detail in Chapter 26.

      These models are not mutually exclusive and are often used together, especially
      for large systems development. For large systems, it makes sense to combine some
      of the best features of the waterfall and the incremental development models. You
      need to have information about the essential system requirements to design a software architecture to support these requirements. You cannot develop this incrementally. 
      Sub-systems within a larger system may be developed using different approaches. 
      Parts of the system that are well understood can be specified and developed using 
      a waterfall-based process. Parts of the system which are difficult to specify in 
      advance, such as the user interface, should always be developed using an incremental approach.

<!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
<p class="text-justify text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed mt-4">
  The first published model of the software development process was derived from
  more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated
  in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known
  as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of
  a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process
  activities before starting work on them.

                In principle, the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approved
                (‘signed off’). The following phase should not start until the previous phase has finished. In practice, these stages overlap and feed information to each other. During
                design, problems with requirements are identified. During coding, design problems
                are found and so on. The software process is not a simple linear model but involves
                feedback from one phase to another. Documents produced in each phase may then

                it is normal to freeze parts of the development, such as the specification, and to continue with the later development stages. Problems are left for later resolution,
                ignored, or programmed around. This premature freezing of requirements may mean
                that the system won’t do what the user wants. It may also lead to badly structured

                The waterfall model is consistent with other engineering process models and documentation is produced at each phase. This makes the process visible so managers can
                monitor progress against the development plan. Its major problem is the inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages. Commitments must be made at an early stage
                in the process, which makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.

                In principle, the waterfall model should only be used when the requirements are
                well understood and unlikely to change radically during system development.
                However, the waterfall model reflects the type of process used in other engineering
                projects. As is easier to use a common management model for the whole project,
                software processes based on the waterfall model are still commonly used.

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed">
                An important variant of the waterfall model is formal system development, where
                a mathematical model of a system specification is created. This model is then
                refined, using mathematical transformations that preserve its consistency, into executable code. Based on the assumption that your mathematical transformations are
                correct, you can therefore make a strong argument that a program generated in this
                way is consistent with its specification.

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed">
                Formal development processes, such as that based on the B method (Schneider,
                2001; Wordsworth, 1996) are particularly suited to the development of systems that
                have stringent safety, reliability, or security requirements. The formal approach simplifies the production of a safety or security case. This demonstrates to customers or
                regulators that the system actually meets its safety or security requirements.

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed">
                Processes based on formal transformations are generally only used in the development of safety-critical or security-critical systems. They require specialized
                expertise. For the majority of systems this process does not offer significant cost-benefits over other approaches to system development.

            Although incremental development has many advantages, it is not problem-free. The primary cause of the
            difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and there
            may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">Sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons—for example, there may be procedures to ensure
            that the software properly implements external regulations (e.g., in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley
            accounting regulations). Changing these procedures may not be possible so process conflicts may be
            unavoidable.</p>

        Incremental development in some form is now the most common approach for the development of application systems.
        This approach can be either plan-driven, agile, or, more usually, a mixture of these approaches. In a plan-driven
        approach, the system increments are identified in advance; if an agile approach is adopted, the early increments are
        identified but the development of later increments depends on progress and customer priorities.

          Managers need regular deliverables to measure progress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective

        different teams develop different parts of the system. These systems require a stable architecture, and team
        responsibilities must be clearly defined in advance rather than developed incrementally.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed">
        You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to customers for comment without deploying it in the customer's
        environment. However, incremental delivery and deployment means real operational use — which can disrupt business
        processes if not properly planned.

      Reuse-Oriented Software Engineering
    </h2>

    <!-- Description -->
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In most software projects, some form of software reuse occurs. This typically involves developers
      recalling existing designs or code that are similar to the project's needs, modifying them, and incorporating
      them into the new system.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In the 21st century, reuse-focused software development processes have become widespread. These rely on a large
      collection of reusable software components and a framework to combine them effectively. Some components may even
      be fully developed systems known as 
      <span class="font-bold text-blue-800">COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf)</span> products.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Below is a general model of the reuse-based software development process:

                    Reuse-oriented software engineering has the obvious advantage of reducing the amount of software that needs to be developed, which helps in lowering development cost and minimizing risks. It also enables faster delivery of software products.

                <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    However, because it uses existing software components, compromises in requirements are sometimes necessary. These compromises might lead to systems that do not fully meet user needs. Also, control over software evolution may be reduced, especially when updates to reused components are managed by external organizations.
