            <h1>The Rational Unified Process</h1>

      <p>
        The Rational Unified Process (RUP) (Krutchen, 2003) is an example of a
        modern process model that has been derived from work on the UML and the
        associated Unified Software Development Process (Rumbaugh, et al., 1999;
        Arlow and Neustadt, 2005). The author have included a description here,
        as it is a good example of a hybrid process model. It brings together
        elements from all of the generic process models (Section 2.1),
        illustrates good practice in specification and design (Section 2.2) and
        supports prototyping and incremental delivery (Section 2.3).
      </p>
          <p>
            The RUP recognizes that conventional process models present a single
            view of the process. In contrast, the RUP is normally described from
            three perspectives:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A dynamic perspective, which shows the phases of the model over
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              A static perspective, which describes the artifacts produced
              during the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              A practice perspective, which suggests good practices to be used
              during the process.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </article>

        <article>
          <p>
            Most descriptions of the RUP attempt to combine the static and
            dynamic perspectives in a single diagram (Krutchen, 2003). The
            author thinks that makes the process harder to understand, so the
            author uses separate descriptions of each of these perspectives
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            The RUP is a phased model that identifies four discrete phases in
            the software process. However, unlike the waterfall model where
            phases are equated with process activities, the phases in the RUP
            are more closely related to business rather than technical concerns.
            Figure 2.11 shows the phases in the RUP. These are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <i>Inception</i> The goal of the inception phase is to establish a
              business case for the system. You should identify all external
              entities (people and systems) that will
              <img src="/iteration.png" alt="phase-iteration.png" /> interact
              with the system and define these interactions. You then use this
              information to assess the contribution that the system makes to
              the business. If this contribution is minor, then the project may
              be cancelled after this phase.
            </li>

            <li>
              <i>Elaboration</i> The goals of the elaboration phase are to
              develop an understanding of the problem domain, establish an
              architectural framework for the system, develop the project plan,
              and identify key project risks. On completion of this phase you
              should have a requirements model for the system, which may be a
              set of UML use-cases, an architectural description, and a
              development plan for the software.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Construction</i> The construction phase involves system design,
              programming, and testing. Parts of the system are developed in
              parallel and integrated during this phase. On completion of this
              phase, you should have a working software system and associated
              documentation that is ready for delivery to users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Transition</i> The final phase of the RUP is concerned with
              moving the system from the development community to the user
              community and making it work in a real environment. This is
              something that is ignored in most software process models but is,
              in fact, an expensive and sometimes problematic activity. On
              completion of this phase, you should have a documented software
              system that is working correctly in its operational environment.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Iteration within the RUP is supported in two ways. Each phase may be
            enacted in an iterative way with the results developed
            incrementally. In addition, the whole set of phases may also be
            enacted incrementally, as shown by the looping arrow from Transition
            to Inception in Figure 2.12.
          </p>

          <p>
            The static view of the RUP focuses on the activities that take place
            during the development process. These are called workflows in the
            RUP description. There are six core process workflows identified in
            the process and three core supporting workflows. The RUP has been
            designed in conjunction with the UML, so the workflow description is
            oriented around associated UML models such as sequence models,
            object models, etc. The core engineering and support workflows are
            described in Figure 2.13.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantage in presenting dynamic and static views is that phases
            of the development process are not associated with specific
            workflows. In principle at least, all of the RUP workflows may be
            active at all stages of the process. In the early phases of the
            process, most effort will probably be spent on workflows such as
            business modelling and requirements and, in the later phases, in
            testing and deployment.

              The practice perspective on the RUP describes good software
              engineering practices that are recommended for use in systems
              development. Six fundamental best practices are recommended:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <i>Develop software iteratively</i> Plan increments of the system based
                on customer priorities and develop the highest-priority system
                features early in the development process.
              </li>
              <li>
                    </i>Manage requirements</i> Explicitly document the customer’s
                requirements and keep track of changes to these requirements.
                Analyze the impact of changes on the system before accepting
                them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Use component-based architectures</i> Structure the system
                architecture into components, as discussed earlier in this
                chapter.
              </li>
              <li>
                </i>Visually model software</i> Use graphical UML models to present
                static and dynamic views of the software.
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Verify software quality</i> Ensure that the software meets the
                organizational quality standards.
              </li>
              <li>
                </i>Control changes to software</i> Manage changes to the software using
                a change management system and configuration management
                procedures and tools.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The RUP is not a suitable process for all types of development,
              e.g., embedded software development. However, it does represent an
              approach that potentially combines the three generic process
              models discussed in Section 2.1. The most important innovations in
              the RUP are the separation of phases and workflows, and the
              recognition that deploying software in a user’s environment is
              part of the process. Phases are dynamic and have goals. Workflows
              are static and are technical activities that are not associated
              with a single phase but may be used throughout the development to
              achieve the goals of each phase.

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Software processes are the activities involved in producing a
                  software system. Software process models are abstract
                  representations of these processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  General process models describe the organization of software
                  processes. Examples of these general models include the
                  waterfall model, incremental development, and reuse-oriented
                  development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Requirements engineering is the process of developing a
                  software specification. Specifications are intended to
                  communicate the system needs of the customer to the system
                  developers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Design and implementation processes are concerned with
                  transforming a requirements specification into an executable
                  software system. Systematic design methods may be used as part
                  of this transformation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Software validation is the process of checking that the system
                  conforms to its specification and that it meets the real needs
                  of the users of the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Software evolution takes place when you change existing
                  software systems to meet new requirements. Changes are
                  continuous and the software must evolve to remain useful.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Processes should include activities to cope with change. This
                  may involve a prototyping phase that helps avoid poor
                  decisions on requirements and design. Processes may be
                  structured for iterative development and delivery so that
                  changes may be made without disrupting the system as a whole.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Rational Unified Process is a modern generic process model
                  that is organized into phases (inception, elaboration,
                  construction, and transition) but separates activities
                  (requirements, analysis, and design, etc.) from these phases.

                  Giving reasons for your answer based on the type of system
                  being developed, suggest the most appropriate generic software
                  process model that might be used as a basis for managing the
                  development of the following systems:

                  <p>A system to control anti-lock braking in a car</p>

                    A virtual reality system to support software maintenance

                </li>
                <li>
                  Explain why incremental development is the most effective
                  approach for developing business software systems. Why is this
                  model less appropriate for real-time systems engineering?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consider the reuse-based process model shown in Figure 2.3.
                  Explain why it is essential to have two separate requirements
                  engineering activities in the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Suggest why it is important to make a distinction between
                  developing the user requirements and developing system
                  requirements in the requirements engineering process.

                  the software being developed more resilient to change.

                <li>
                  Explain why systems developed as prototypes should not

                <li>
                  Explain why Boehm’s spiral model is an adaptable model that
                  can support both change avoidance and change tolerance
                  activities. In practice, this model has not been widely used.
                  Suggest why this might be the case.

                  What are the advantages of providing static and dynamic views

                  Historically, the introduction of technology has caused
                  profound changes in the labor market and, temporarily at
                  least, displaced people from jobs. Discuss whether the
                  introduction of extensive process automation is likely to have
                  the same consequences for software engineers. If you don’t
                  think it will, explain why not. If you think that it will
                  reduce job opportunities, is it ethical for the engineers
                  affected to passively or actively resist the introduction of
                  this technology?
