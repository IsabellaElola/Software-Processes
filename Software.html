            <h4>2.1 Software process models</h4>
            <p>As the author explained in Chapter 1, a software process model is a simplified representation
                of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. For example,
                a process activity model shows the activities and their sequence but may not show
                the roles of the people involved in these activities. In this section, I introduce a number of very general process models (sometimes called ‘process paradigms’) and
                present these from an architectural perspective. That is, we see the framework of the
                process but not the details of specific activities.</p>
            <p>These generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes. Rather,
                they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to
                software development. You can think of them as process frameworks that may be
                extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.</p>
            <p>The process models that I cover here are:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The waterfall model This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate
                    process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on.</li>
                <p> 30 Chapter 2 Sofware processes</p>
                    <img src="/1stpic.PNG" alt="">
                <li>Incremental development This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions
                    (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.</li>
                <li>Reuse-oriented software engineering This approach is based on the existence of
                    a significant number of reusable components. The system development process
                    focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing
                    them from scratch.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>2.1.1 The framewall model</p>
            <p>These models are not mutually exclusive and are often used together, especially
                for large systems development. For large systems, it makes sense to combine some
                of the best features of the waterfall and the incremental development models. You
                need to have information about the essential system requirements to design a software architecture to support these requirements. You cannot develop this incrementally. Sub-systems within a larger system may be developed using different
                approaches. Parts of the system that are well understood can be specified and developed using a waterfall-based process. Parts of the system which are difficult to
                specify in advance, such as the user interface, should always be developed using an
                incremental approach.</p>
            <p>The first published model of the software development process was derived from
                more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated
                in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known
                as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of
                a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process
                activities before starting work on them.</p>
            
                <p>2.1 ■ Sofreware models</p>
            <ol>
                <p>The principal stages of the waterfall model directly reflect the fundamental development activities:</p>
                <li>Requirements analysis and definition The system’s services, constraints, and
                    goals are established by consultation with system users. They are then defined
                    in detail and serve as a system specification.</li>
                <li>System and software design The systems design process allocates the requirements to either hardware or software systems by establishing an overall system
                    architecture. Software design involves identifying and describing the fundamental software system abstractions and their relationships.</li>
                <li>Implementation and unit testing During this stage, the software design is realized as a set of programs or program units. Unit testing involves verifying that
                    each unit meets its specification.</li>
                <li>Integration and system testing The individual program units or programs
                    are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software
                    requirements have been met. After testing, the software system is delivered to
                    the customer.</li>
                <li> Operation and maintenance Normally (although not necessarily), this is the
                    longest life cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use.
                    Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in earlier
                    stages of the life cycle, improving the implementation of system units and
                    enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered.</li>
                </ol>
           
                <p>In principle, the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approved
                    (‘signed off’). The following phase should not start until the previous phase has finished. In practice, these stages overlap and feed information to each other. During
                    design, problems with requirements are identified. During coding, design problems
                    are found and so on. The software process is not a simple linear model but involves
                    feedback from one phase to another. Documents produced in each phase may then
                    have to be modified to reflect the changes made.</p>
                <p>Because of the costs of producing and approving documents, iterations can be
                    costly and involve significant rework. Therefore, after a small number of iterations,
                    it is normal to freeze parts of the development, such as the specification, and to continue with the later development stages. Problems are left for later resolution,
                    ignored, or programmed around. This premature freezing of requirements may mean
                    that the system won’t do what the user wants. It may also lead to badly structured
                    systems as design problems are circumvented by implementation tricks.</p>
                <p>During the final life cycle phase (operation and maintenance) the software is put
                    into use. Errors and omissions in the original software requirements are discovered.
                    Program and design errors emerge and the need for new functionality is identified.
                    The system must therefore evolve to remain useful. Making these changes (software
                    maintenance) may involve repeating previous process stages.</p>

                        <p>Cleanroom software engineering</p>
                        <p>An example of a formal development process, originally developed by IBM, is the Cleanroom process. In the
                            Cleanroom process each software increment is formally specified and this specification is transformed into an
                            implementation. Software correctness is demonstrated using a formal approach. There is no unit testing for
                            defects in the process and the system testing is focused on assessing the system’s reliability</p>
                        <p>The objective of the Cleanroom process is zero-defects software so that delivered systems have a high level of reliability.</p>

                        <h3> 1.1 ■ Professional software development 5 </h3>
                        <p>Lots of people write programs. People in business write spreadsheet programs to
                            simplify their jobs, scientists and engineers write programs to process their experimental data, and hobbyists write programs for their own interest and enjoyment.
                            However, the vast majority of software development is a professional activity where
                            software is developed for specific business purposes, for inclusion in other devices,
                            or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. Professional
                            software, intended for use by someone apart from its developer, is usually developed
                            by teams rather than individuals. It is maintained and changed throughout its life.</p>
                        <p>Software engineering is intended to support professional software development,
                            rather than individual programming. It includes techniques that support program
                            specification, design, and evolution, none of which are normally relevant for personal software development. To help you to get a broad view of what software engineering is about, I have summarized some frequently asked questions in Figure 1.1.</p>
                        <p>Many people think that software is simply another word for computer programs.
                            However, when we are talking about software engineering, software is not just the
                            programs themselves but also all associated documentation and configuration data
                            that is required to make these programs operate correctly. A professionally developed software system is often more than a single program. The system usually consists of a number of separate programs and configuration files that are used to set up
                            these programs. It may include system documentation, which describes the structure
                            of the system; user documentation, which explains how to use the system, and websites for users to download recent product information.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the important differences between professional and amateur software development. If you are writing a program for yourself, no one else will use it
                            and you don’t have to worry about writing program guides, documenting the program design, etc. However, if you are writing software that other people will use and
                            other engineers will change then you usually have to provide additional information
                            as well as the code of the program.</p>
                    </article>




                    <p>The waterfall model is consistent with other engineering process models and documentation is produced at each phase. This makes the process visible so managers can
                        monitor progress against the development plan. Its major problem is the inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages. Commitments must be made at an early stage
                        in the process, which makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.</p>
                    <p>In principle, the waterfall model should only be used when the requirements are
                        well understood and unlikely to change radically during system development.
                        However, the waterfall model reflects the type of process used in other engineering
                        projects. As is easier to use a common management model for the whole project,
                        software processes based on the waterfall model are still commonly used.</p>
                    <p>An important variant of the waterfall model is formal system development, where
                        a mathematical model of a system specification is created. This model is then
                        refined, using mathematical transformations that preserve its consistency, into executable code. Based on the assumption that your mathematical transformations are
                        correct, you can therefore make a strong argument that a program generated in this
                        way is consistent with its specification.</p>
                    <p>Formal development processes, such as that based on the B method (Schneider,
                        2001; Wordsworth, 1996) are particularly suited to the development of systems that
                        have stringent safety, reliability, or security requirements. The formal approach simplifies the production of a safety or security case. This demonstrates to customers or
                        regulators that the system actually meets its safety or security requirements.</p>
                    <p>Processes based on formal transformations are generally only used in the development of safety-critical or security-critical systems. They require specialized
                        expertise. For the majority of systems this process does not offer significant costbenefits over other approaches to system development.</p>

                    <img src="/2ndpic.PNG" alt="">

                    <p>Figure 1.1 Frequently
                        asked questions about
                        software</p>

                    <p>Software engineers are concerned with developing software products (i.e., software which can be sold to a customer). There are two kinds of software products:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Generic products These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a development organization and sold on the open market to any customer who is able to
                            buy them. Examples of this type of product include software for PCs such as
                            databases, word processors, drawing packages, and project-management tools.
                            It also includes so-called vertical applications designed for some specific purpose such as library information systems, accounting systems, or systems for
                            maintaining dental records.</li>
                        <li>Customized (or bespoke) products These are systems that are commissioned by
                            a particular customer. A software contractor develops the software especially
                            for that customer. Examples of this type of software include control systems for
                            electronic devices, systems written to support a particular business process, and
                            air traffic control systems.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        <p>An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products,
                            the organization that develops the software controls the software specification. For custom products, the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization
                            that is buying the software. The software developers must work to that specification.</p>
                        <p>However, the distinction between these system product types is becoming
                            increasingly blurred. More and more systems are now being built with a generic
                            product as a base, which is then adapted to suit the requirements of a customer.
                            Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, such as the SAP system, are the best
                            examples of this approach. Here, a large and complex system is adapted for a company by incorporating information about business rules and processes, reports
                            required, and so on.</p>
                        <p>When we talk about the quality of professional software, we have to take into
                            account that the software is used and changed by people apart from its developers.
                            Quality is therefore not just concerned with what the software does. Rather, it has to
                            include the software’s behavior while it is executing and the structure and organization
                            of the system programs and associated documentation. This is reflected in so-called
                            quality or non-functional software attributes. Examples of these attributes are the software’s response time to a user query and the understandability of the program code.</p>
                        <p>The specific set of attributes that you might expect from a software system obviously depends on its application. Therefore, a banking system must be secure, an
                            interactive game must be responsive, a telephone switching system must be reliable,
                            and so on. These can be generalized into the set of attributes shown in Figure 1.2,
                            which I believe are the essential characteristics of a professional software system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2.1.2 Incremental development</h3>

                        <p>Incremental development is based on the idea of developing an initial implementation, exposing this to user comment and evolving it through several versions until an
                            adequate system has been developed (Figure 2.2). Specification, development, and</p>
                       <img src="/2nd_pic.PNG" alt="">
                       <p>validation activities are interleaved rather than separate, with rapid feedback across activities.</p>

                       <p>Incremental software development, which is a fundamental part of agile
                        approaches, is better than a waterfall approach for most business, e-commerce, and
                        personal systems. Incremental development reflects the way that we solve problems. We rarely work out a complete problem solution in advance but move toward
                        a solution in a series of steps, backtracking when we realize that we have made a
                        mistake. By developing the software incrementally, it is cheaper and easier to make
                        changes in the software as it is being developed.</p>
                        <p>Each increment or version of the system incorporates some of the functionality
                        that is needed by the customer. Generally, the early increments of the system include
                        the most important or most urgently required functionality. This means that the
                        customer can evaluate the system at a relatively early stage in the development to see
                        if it delivers what is required. If not, then only the current increment has to be
                        changed and, possibly, new functionality defined for later increments.</p>
                        <p>Incremental development has three important benefits, compared to the waterfall model:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced. The
                                amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less than is
                                required with the waterfall model.</li>
                            <li> It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been
                                done. Customers can comment on demonstrations of the software and see how
                                much has been implemented. Customers find it difficult to judge progress from
                                software design documents.</li>
                            <li> More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible, even if all of the functionality has not been included. Customers are able to

                                Problems with incremental development
                            </section>
                            <p>Although incremental development has many advantages, it is not problem-free. The primary cause of the
                                difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and there
                                may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons—for example, there may be procedures to ensure
                                that the software properly implements external regulations (e.g., in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley
                                accounting regulations). Changing these procedures may not be possible so process conflicts may be
                                unavoidable.</p>
                            <a href="http://ww25.softwareengineering-9.com/Web/"></a>   
                        </article>
                        
                        <p>Incremental development in some form is now the most common approach for the
                            development of application systems. This approach can be either plan-driven, agile,
                            or, more usually, a mixture of these approaches. In a plan-driven approach, the system
                            increments are identified in advance; if an agile approach is adopted, the early increments are identified but the development of later increments depends on progress and
                            customer priorities.</p>
                        <p>From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems:</p>
                       
                        <ol>
                            <li>The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure
                                progress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to produce
                                documents that reflect every version of the system.</li>        
                            <li>System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Unless time and
                                money is spent on refactoring to improve the software, regular change tends to
                                corrupt its structure. Incorporating further software changes becomes increasingly difficult and costly.</li>        
                        </ol>

                        <p>The problems of incremental development become particularly acute for large,
                            complex, long-lifetime systems, where different teams develop different parts of the
                            system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture and the responsibilities of the different teams working on parts of the system need to be clearly defined
                            with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather than developed incrementally</p>
                        <p>You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to customers for comment,
                            without actually delivering it and deploying it in the customer’s environment.
                            Incremental delivery and deployment means that the software is used in real, operational processes. This is not always possible as experimenting with new software can
                            disrupt normal business processes. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of incremental delivery in Section 2.3.2.</p>

                        <h3>2.1.3 Reuse-oriented software engineering</h3>
                        <p>In the majority of software projects, there is some software reuse. This often happens
                            informally when people working on the project know of designs or code that are
                            similar to what is required. They look for these, modify them as needed, and incorporate them into their system.</p>
                        <p>This informal reuse takes place irrespective of the development process that is
                            used. However, in the 21st century, software development processes that focus on the
                            reuse of existing software have become widely used. Reuse-oriented approaches rely
                            on a large base of reusable software components and an integrating framework for
                            the composition of these components. Sometimes, these components are systems in
                            their own right (COTS or commercial off-the-shelf systems) that may provide specific functionality such as word processing or a spreadsheet.</p>
                        <p>A general process model for reuse-based development is shown in Figure 2.3.
                            Although the initial requirements specification stage and the validation stage are
                            comparable with other software processes, the intermediate stages in a reuseoriented process are different. These stages are:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <p>Component analysis Given the requirements specification, a search is made for
                                components to implement that specification. Usually, there is no exact match and
                                the components that may be used only provide some of the functionality required.</p>
                            <p>Requirements modification During this stage, the requirements are analyzed using
                                information about the components that have been discovered. They are then modified to reflect the available components. Where modifications are impossible, the
                                component analysis activity may be re-entered to search for alternative solutions.</p>
                            <p>System design with reuse During this phase, the framework of the system is
                                designed or an existing framework is reused. The designers take into account the
                                components that are reused and organize the framework to cater for this. Some
                                new software may have to be designed if reusable components are not available.</p>
                            <p>Development and integration Software that cannot be externally procured is
                                developed, and the components and COTS systems are integrated to create the
                                new system. System integration, in this model, may be part of the development
                                process rather than a separate activity</p>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>36 Chapter 2 ■ Software processes</h3>
                        <p>Reuse-oriented software engineering has the obvious advantage of reducing the
                            amount of software to be developed and so reducing cost and risks. It usually also
                            leads to faster delivery of the software. However, requirements compromises are
                            inevitable and this may lead to a system that does not meet the real needs of users.
                            Furthermore, some control over the system evolution is lost as new versions of the
                            reusable components are not under the control of the organization using them.</p>
                        <p>Software reuse is very important and I have dedicated several chapters in the third
                            part of the book to this topic. General issues of software reuse and COTS reuse are
                            covered in Chapter 16, component-based software engineering in Chapters 17 and
                            18, and service-oriented systems in Chapter 19.</p>

                        <h3>2.2 Process activities</h3>
                        <p>Real software processes are interleaved sequences of technical, collaborative, and
                            managerial activities with the overall goal of specifying, designing, implementing,
                            and testing a software system. Software developers use a variety of different software
                            tools in their work. Tools are particularly useful for supporting the editing of different
                            types of document and for managing the immense volume of detailed information
                            that is generated in a large software project.</p>
                        <p>The four basic process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are organized differently in different development processes. In the waterfall
                            model, they are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are
                            interleaved. How these activities are carried out depends on the type of software,
                            people, and organizational structures involved. In extreme programming, for example,
                            specifications are written on cards. Tests are executable and developed before the
                            program itself. Evolution may involve substantial system restructuring or refactoring.</p>
